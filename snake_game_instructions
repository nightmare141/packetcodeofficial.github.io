a) Capture and paste two program code segments you developed during the administration of this task that contain a student-developed procedure that
implements an algorithm used in your program and a call to that procedure:
  The first program code segment screenshot must be a student-developed
  procedure that:
    ○ Defines the procedure's name and return type (if necessary)
    ○ Contains and uses one or more parameters that have an effect on the
    functionality of the procedure
    ○ Implements an algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration
    
    
b) Describes two calls to the procedure identified in written response a). Each call
must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the
algorithm to execute.
